								<p>Name: Darius Baluyut</p>
								<p>Student Number: s3786863</p>
								<p>Email Address: s3786863@student.rmit.edu.au<p>
								<p>My name is Darius Baluyut and my nationility is filipino (Philippines). I studied primary school, high school and senior high school at Sydney, NSW and now currently studying as a first year student at RMIT University. I can speak filipino (Tagalog) but I am more fluent and mostly prefer to speak English. In my pastime I mostly play video games on my laptop and Nintendo switch or watch anime and read manga through my phone. My current hobby is playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Nintendo switch.<p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In IT, I am interested in game development and programming or developing software. My main interest in game development started I was introduced to video games at a young age since I enjoyed and spent a lot of time playing games while I was younger. Both my brother and I were introduced to video games by my dad and I have been enjoying video games since I was very competitive.</p>
								<p>I chose to study at RMIT because my brother told me that it was a good school for studying Information Technology based on his own experiences. I didn’t know much options since I had just moved here from Sydney apart from University of Melbourne, but I was told that RMIT focuses more on the IT industry.</p>
								<p>In my studies, I expect to learn the basic skills for Information Technology such as general IT, program development, database management and software designs.</p>

								<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38654601?searchrequesttoken=8f819a11-b982-445f-b68a-d4c915e7c3b3&type=standout">Link to ideal job</a></p>
								<br>
								<p>My ideal job is to be a software developer or something similar such as game development. This job allows me to create my own code and work on projects that use programming languages such as C# and others. It also allows me to work together with others on the same project in order to achieve our main goal in developing software. This position is appealing to me since I enjoy developing software through programming languages and creating functional projects using my knowledge. I find it very satisfying to finally complete a project after many trials and errors.</p>
								<p>For this position, I will be required to be proficient in database structures and ERD, as well as the ability to work in a team. This includes proper self-management and the ability to work with tight deadlines. I will be required to have proficient skills in programming and scripting languages such as C#, Java, SQL, PHP, ASP.net and Javascript/Typescript. These are languages used in software development to create various software. I will also be required to have proficiency in Angular, Node.js, Xamarin. These are the platforms that I will be using in this position to write my code in both programming and scripting languages. This position also requires me to have the specific qualifications and work experience necessary for the job. I will need a tertiary degree in software engineering or information technology and at least 3 or more years of experience in software development.</p>
								<p>I currently have the basic skills of using the programming languages C#, Java and SQL and have the basic skills in creating database structures and ERD. I am also capable in working together in groups and I’m able to manage myself to suit most of my deadlines. My current experience in software development consists of using my knowledge in programming in senior school projects.</p>
								<p>I plan to obtain the required skills in this position through my time studying at RMIT. I will try to learn these skills and improve on the current skills I have in order to be proficient in the skills required for this position. I will also try to continue working on managing myself and working in teams. I will try to complete most of my work much earlier in order to be capable of working in tight deadlines. I plan to obtain a tertiary degree in information technology by completing this course throughout my time at RMIT and will look for opportunities to work in software development in order to obtain the required 3 years of experience.</p>

								<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
								<p>The results of these tests show me the type of person I am, including my personality type, how I like to learn and what type of person I am in general. For me, these tests are important to consider when doing any tasks since it shows me how I like to do things best and what some of my strong points are. The tests also show me what I am lacking in which I can use to improve myself and overcome my own weaknesses. I can take advantage of these tests in the future since I now understand my way of thinking and how I like to do things whilst also understanding what key points I need to work on to improve overall.</p>
								<br>
								<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
								<p>I think that these tests will influence my behaviour in a team since the tests can depict my personality and way of learning best. The results would heavily influence how I would behave in a team since it shows me how I like to get things done, which I can implement when working in a team. The tests also show me what I would need to improve. Knowing this, I would try to improve these aspects in order to fulfil my set tasks within the team.</p>
								<br>
								<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
								<p>I should take these tests into account when forming a team by checking my weak points and either try to overcome them or find other team members that would work best with my type of personality. This could also include other people of the similar learning style. This can improve how I work with my team since we would have similar learning styles, making things much easier to understand each other once we start working on our group tasks.</p>

						<!-- Project Ideas -->
							<article id="ideas">
								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My idea for a project is to develop a game using Unity. The game would be designed as a shoot ‘em up game. Shoot ‘em up or Shmup is a subgenre for the typical shooter genre in video games. Some popular games of this game genre are space invaders and galaga, where the player controls a space craft of some sort shooting obstacles and enemies above whilst being restricted to the basic character movement (up, down, left and right). The game that I plan to create would be similar to these popular games and will have a science fiction theme. The main goal of the game would be to survive as long as the player can, increasing difficulty as they progress, and achieve higher scores. In order to survive, the player must avoid any enemies and their shots by shooting them first, adding to their total score. The player will be given either a life bar or lives that they should keep watch of because once it is fully depleted, the player will lose.</p>
								<p>I believe that this project will be interesting since shoot ‘em up games are very rare in modern video games, making this project unique. There is a huge industry in interactive games and entertainment and there is currently an ongoing growth in the gaming community within Australia as each year passes. This project will bring a unique game genre into the current game industry, giving a fresh genre for new gamers and a nostalgic genre for the older generations. Using a game engine such as Unity, the budget for this project will remain cheap and can be easily programmed after thorough research and studying its tools and capabilities.</p>
								<p>The game will consist of a retro theme. I think that this theme would suit very well with he shoot ‘em up genre to keep the basic feel of the game since the controls aren’t difficult to learn. The levels for this game would be somewhat similar to games such as cuphead, easy to learn but difficult to master. It brings a challenge to the game even though the design isn’t too complex. The game would be within the theme of science fiction, since the player will be controlling various space crafts, shooting at other incoming enemy space crafts which can be depicted through different colours or shapes.</p>
								<p>In terms gameplay, the player would start off with a standard space craft which can be changed later as the player progresses to unlock other types of ships. These space crafts would need to be balanced, to avoid any abuse of over powered tools and forcing players to pick the “best”. The space crafts would be differed by play style. This can be done by making some faster, deal more damage or have more health. An example would be a tanky space craft would have a significantly more health and deal more damage compared to the standard space craft but can be balanced by making it much slower. The gameplay could also include random power-ups that sometimes appear around the screen. These can give the player buffs that can help them survive much longer such as power-ups that can make them shoot twice as fast, power-ups that can increase their speed or even give them an extra gun to shoot with. Some power-ups could also have the ability to “stack” effects. An example of this would be that if the player picks up two speed power-ups, their added speed would stack twice, making them faster. This might take some time and thinking before it is implemented since it could influence imbalance between the other space crafts once a certain number of power-ups are collected.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								<p>The progression of this game can be made through a levelling system. This can be done by creating levels with certain amounts of experience points required in order to level up. Doing this, the player can be rewarded by unlocking other space crafts. The main goal of the game would be to survive as long as possible. As the player progresses, the enemies would become harder. This can be done by creating more enemies with higher health or do more damage when they shoot, but bosses could also be added to make the game more interesting. This would mean that the player will have to learn their habits to figure out their weaknesses. This will need to be done whilst also avoiding any other enemies and the increasing amount of shots that the bosses and enemies make. Many of these bosses will need many trials in order to fully understand their move set. The idea of the game difficulty is that it is easy to learn but difficult to master. This is because the player is forced to avoid as many shots as possible whilst shooting back in order to survive.</p>
								<p>The software that will be required to make this project would be Unity and the operating systems Windows, macOS and Linux. Unity is a game engine developed by Unity Technologies that supports around 27 platforms and can be used to create both two-dimensional and three-dimensional video games. Unity uses the programming language C# and is also able to use JavaScript. The hardware required for this project would be a keyboard which will be used by the player to control their character. The project would also be capable of supporting controllers instead of the keyboard, depending on the player’s preference. This would be added as extra equipment once the project is working.</p>
								<p>The necessary skills required to create this project would be general knowledge in programming C#. Since Unity is capable of using the programming language C#, the required skills can be achieved through research and other prior experience with C#. It won’t be difficult to find the required skills, software and hardware required. Since this project will mostly be using C# in Unity, and the game mechanics can easily achieved, the skills required can be found without any problems. The game also wouldn’t require any heavy graphics usages and most people would already own a keyboard, the required hardware is also feasible. The main software used for this project is Unity, which can be downloaded from their website and can be set up for use.</p>
								<p>Some problems that can occur when creating this project is my inability to proficiently use C#. Although the project doesn’t require much prior knowledge in using C#, I still might be unable to complete certain tasks. This means that I will require to research any necessary tutorials in order to complete this project. Designing the game could also be difficult as the look of the game can influence many players in either choosing to play the game or avoid it completely. Another issue that I could face when creating this project would be being unable to fully complete the game. With more time and other specialists, creating and finishing the finalised product can be achieved easily.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful, the game will bring back an “old favourite” genre into the modern entertainment industry. It can bring a fresh new genre for younger people to experience due to the scarce mounts of shoot ‘em up type games that people currently play. It can also impact older generation gamers with nostalgia due to this being similar to the retro games such as space invaders and galaga.</p>
